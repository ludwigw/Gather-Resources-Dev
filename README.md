Gather-Resources-Dev
====================

These are the files used to build gathergather.co.nz/resources/


We use mDoc (on Node.js) to build out these files. Then upload them to the server. Under each docs area (eg. "building-the-web") is a content folder containing the pages in that docs section as Markdown files. Edit these.
